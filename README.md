# SYSlang
SYSlang, the open-source multi-functional coding language.
To import assets, use 'lang-imp {asset name}'

If you are installing SYStemware (deamos) please be careful. It is recommended to use a VM, as an incorrect installation can completely corrupt the harddrive.
It is recommended to have at least 6 Gib available space for the GUI's + apps.
If you are coding an app with SYSlang, please be patient. Building will be out soon.
