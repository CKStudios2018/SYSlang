# SYSlang
SYSlang, the open-source multi-functional coding language.
To import assets, use 'lang-imp {asset name}'

If you are installing SYStemware (deamos) please be careful. It is recommended to use a VM, as an incorrect installation can completely corrupt the harddrive.
It is recommended to have at least 6 Gib available space for the GUI's + apps.
If you are coding an app with SYSlang, please be patient. Building will be out soon.

Please note: This is not an installer. These files are addons for SYStemware. If you don't want to use SYStemware, the same result can be obtained using any SYS-(language) translator, such as V1RU5' SYS-JS Translator.
