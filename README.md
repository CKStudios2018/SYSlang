# SYSlang
SYSlang, is an open-source multi-functional coding language.
To import assets, use 'lang-imp {asset name}'

Please note: This is not an installer. These files are part of SYStemware. If you don't want to use SYStemware's OS, the same results can usually be obtained using any SYS-(coding language) translator, such as V1RU5' SYS-CMDlet Translator, a translator to use SYSlang in Windows CMD (requires administrator perms).

If you are installing SYStemware (deamos) please be careful. It is recommended to use a VM, as an incorrect installation can completely corrupt the harddrive.

It is recommended to have at least 6.4 Gib available space for the GUI's + apps and some additional tools that are required for SYSl development. It is also recommended to use a VM (Virtual Machine).
